## ⭐️ How to change the template
- Rename repo
- Create project in dokku with same name (potentially also change the dokku backend)
- Github Actions workflow should be changed to the dokku project created for the template copy (not `server`) anymore
- API will be availble under `new_project_name.bulbt.com`
